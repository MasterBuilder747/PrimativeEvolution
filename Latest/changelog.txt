"new" [pre] alpha: continued development of mod from scratch, fully implementing everything from ablove, but by raw coding instead of MCcreator (since it is now for 1.12, and MCcreator isnt avalible for that version)

versions are now 0.1.XXX; the 1 indicates the real coded version for 1.12 exclusively, in pre-alpha atm

000: getting general idea of coding again, mod is not stable atm but will be fixed soon
001: mod is stable, but the item seems to have some registry issues and does not show up in creative tabs, give command, etc.
002: removed minecraft.[...] command and used modloader instead for item init
003: added a new creative tab for the item, no such luck still with finding the item
004: changed tab to "redstone" type, no such luck still, registry must still be corrupted
