Primative Evolution is just a fancy name for a simple mod that adds extra items to my 1.12 modpack. I have decided to train myself to learn a bit of coding to make my own mod that does this instead of using MCCreator like I did before (it currently isn't avalible for 1.12, anyways). Hopefully I can get through this and can have some fun along the way :P

More info on my ideas for this mod and how it will be implemented in my pack are in: Latest/changelog.txt in the GitHub repository
-Unfortunetly i was previously working on this with MCcreator, and I had to start over in order to do this the right way
